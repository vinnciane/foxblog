Renard is an ambiguous term that most often refers to canids of the genus Vulpes, the most common being the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). However, because of its physical similarity, the term is also used to designate canids belonging to other genera, such as Atelocynus, Cerdocyon, Dusicyon, Otocyon, Lycalopex and Urocyon. In popular culture, the fox is a symbolic and literary character who represents intelligence and, above all, cunning.
