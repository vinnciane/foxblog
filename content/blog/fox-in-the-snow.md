### Abstract

The inspiration behind “The Fox in the Snow” is a subject of curiosity for many fans. While the band has not explicitly stated the exact inspiration, the song contains elements of introspection and loneliness, which are often recurrent themes in their music. It is likely that their personal experiences or observations of the human condition played a significant role in shaping this mesmerizing song.  


### Lyrics

Fox in the snow, where do you go  
To find something you could eat?  
'Cause the word out on the street is you are starving  
Don't let yourself grow hungry now  
Don't let yourself grow cold  
Fox in the snow  

Girl in the snow, where do you go  
To find someone you will do?  
To tell someone all the truth before it kills you  
They listen to your crazy laugh  
Before you hang a right  
And disappear from sight  
What do they know anyway?  
You'll read it in a book  
What do they know anyway?  
You'll read it in a book tonight  

Boy on the bike, what are you like  
As you cycle 'round the town?  
You're going up, you're going down  
You're going nowhere  
It's not as if they're paying you  
It's not as if it's fun  
At least not anymore   
When your legs are black and blue  
It's time to take a break  
When your legs are black and blue  
It's time to take a holiday  

Kid in the snow, way to go  
It only happens once a year  
It only happens once a lifetime  
Make the most of it  
Second just to being born  
Second to dying too  
What else could you do?  
What else would you do?  
What else would you do?  
What else would you do?  

Fox in the snow (When your legs look black and blue)  
Fox in the snow (It's not as if they're paying you)  
Fox in the snow (When your legs look black and blue)  
Fox in the snow (It's not as if they're paying you)  
Fox in the snow  
Fox in the snow
