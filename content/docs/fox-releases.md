Arctic foxes released into wild amid climate change concerns

The programme has proven a success so far but concerns remain that the animals cannot be supported in a changing environment long-term.  

Norway has sponsored an Arctic fox breeding programme for nearly 20 years in an effort to boost species numbers across the Nordic region. Since its introduction, the programme has increased population size from as few as 40 foxes in Norway, Finland, and Sweden to around 550 across Scandinavia today. 

The foxes are bred in captivity and then released in Hardangervidda National Park, with this male white fox being transported to its new home in a wooden crate.
