1. Define the features of the fox within your rough outline.  
For instance, give the tail more of an upward curl within the outline you just made. Likewise, define the insides of the ears and the toes on the paws. Add a curved “dent” to the top front of the head oval to help define the muzzle, then sketch in a smiling mouth and a rounded nose and eyes.
Since this is a cartoon fox, there’s lots of room for individuality here. You can make your fox look a bit more human, a little more realistic, or any other way you like!

1. Darken the finishing lines and erase your original sketching lines.  
Go over the features you just created with a pen or marker to make them permanent. After that, use an eraser to get rid of any excess pencil lines from your original sketching.

3. Color your cartoon fox to finish it off.  
“Burnt orange” is a good color choice for a fox, but you might want to give a cartoon fox more of a reddish color. Add in some off-white areas on the chest, muzzle, lower legs, paws, and tail.
You can use the layering technique to blend colored pencils. For example, you can color the area red. Then color yellow on top of it to create orange.
If you like to see the texture of the pencil marks, just add one color on top of the other.
Otherwise, rub those colors with your finger to blend them.
